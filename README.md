## Goals and Stuff

My goals for Elementary are as follows:

- To create the easiest CMS for managing content through a web-interface and desktop app.
- To create a developer-friendly environment for creating plugins, themes and new content.
- Create a system that is capable enough to manage content, but powerful enough to build a mobile app with real-time in mind.

## What is this?

Currently this project is in development. 

The project is basically a Content Management System. You will have your basic pages, posts, and the admin. Though, there are a few super features that you may find interesting such as: layout and component based themes. Server and client-side plugins is an idea. It's been an idea for a while, but now it's getting created.

Here is a basic feature list of what the CMS will entai in the near future.

- Full control of the server environment which would include: custom routers, hooks, middleware, database, api and authentication methods. >>>>>>>>>>

- A robust CLI to help creators customize, build, test, and deploy your site(s). >>>>>>>>>

- A new way to think about themes. >>>>>>>>>

- An easy to use Administration system to manage content and appearance. >>>>>>>>>

- Plugins that can extend most of the applicaiton. >>>>>>>>>

- Automatically compile SCSS, LESS, CoffeeScript. Middleware can also extend this functionality. >>>>>>>

- Local development and build tools.
